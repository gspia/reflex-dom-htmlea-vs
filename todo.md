# TODO-list

- [ ] TableVS: some of the initializations (initially selected rows and columns)
      could use something other than Ints. Finites?
- [ ] Vector partitioning is needed for the col and row headers. It should work
      such that the sum of the partitions equals the corresponding vector.
      How to do?


Generally, see todo's for TableV for other things (located in 
[reflex-dom-htmlea](https://github.com/gspia/reflex-dom-htmlea) -package).
